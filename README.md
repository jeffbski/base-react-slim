This is a **minimal React.js boilerplate with an auto build environment w/o testing** which you can fork and clone to easily setup your own projects. This is a slimmed down boilerpate without any test framework which is useful for workshops, demos

Tip: Using [git-clone-init](https://github.com/jeffbski/git-clone-init) makes this very simple. (non-windows users)

`git-clone-init https://github.com/jeffbski/base-react-slim.git myProjectName`
